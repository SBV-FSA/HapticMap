# HapticMap App

## Introduction
Mobility is one of the many challenges blind or visually impaired people face. This application allows users to explore simplified indoor or outdoor venue maps by moving their fingers on the screen. Precise haptic feedback, sounds, and audio descriptions are given depending on the element under the finger. By doing so, users can understand any map even when having no vision, allowing them to gain autonomy and confidence in their everyday lives.

## Origins of the Project
This project is the result of an [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) master thesis completed by [Timoth√©e Duran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timotheeduran) at [ELCA](https://www.elca.ch), a Swiss company specialized in software development and based in Lausanne.

During this project, a collaboration with the [Swiss Association for the Blind and Visually Impaired SBV-FSA](https://sbv-fsa.ch/fr) has taken place, and the project has been transfered and open-sourced.

The thesis containing results of the UX research as well as more information about this project can be found in the file `making-maps-accessible_master-thesis_timothee-duran.pdf`.

## Future of the Project
The [Swiss Association for the Blind and Visually Impaired](https://sbv-fsa.ch/fr) has to goal to take this project further and is currently developing a framework for use in existing apps. The goal is to represent any existing indoor or outdoor maps using haptic and audio feedback.
